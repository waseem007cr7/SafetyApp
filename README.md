This is the repository of my final year project I'll be uploading all the necessary things related to my project and also i will be updating any changes that i make to my project.

## Introduction
Womenâ€™s and children safety is a big concern in now-a-days. Although the government is taking necessary measures for their safety, still, there is a need to timely inform the concerned authorities regarding alert situation.

### This App
Almost every women and child carry smartphone with them while leaving home. By installing this app, they can send an alert to the emergency contact added to the application by simply just shaking their phone 3 times. Also the parents can see their child live location and can create safe zones for them.
